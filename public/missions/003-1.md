# Mission // #003-1
# Requestor: Oliver Conrad
## Mission Class: F-tier
## Mission Title: Investigate Sabotage

Greetings mercenaries. This request comes from **Oliver Conrad**, a representative of the farmers working on artificial colony **Asteria-03**. Please, pay attention to the following message.

*"Howdy. My name is Oliver Conrad. I am making this request on behalf of my fellow colleagues and citizens. Recently, we've noticed severe acts of vandalism, committed against our very livelihoods: Our crops and farms. Our efforts to find who's behind these attacks have proven fruitless and we are at our wits' end. Ever since the war started, we have depended on our rich yields, facilitated by the colony's specialized design, in order to mitigate losses that we incured from tariffs imposed by both sides, due to our stance of neutrality. Trade is limited and dangerous and as such, is not a long-term option. Please, help us figure out what's going on.  We don't have much to offer, but we have managed to collect a sizable sum of **tokens** between all of us. We await your response."*
