## Mission Title: Oh Ye Little of Faith

This is a request from the grand priest-elect of the planet Luma, one of the major members of the L.A.C. Please pay attention to the following message.

*"Hail to you all. I seek your assistance in this time of need. I am Grand Priest Benedict the Second, elected head of faith of Luma. Allow me to explain our predicament. We have recently been suffering from a series of attacks against holy monuments and natural preserves from unknown parties, which has caused our flock to start doubting our light-given right to reject the shackles of imperial authority. We consider this an act of violence not only against the state but our very way of living as well. We request a group of seasoned mercenaries to conduct an independent investigation and discover the truth behind these attacks. We await your response and will provide further details upon acceptance. Archon be with you."*
