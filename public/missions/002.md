# Mission // #002
## Motherland Under Attack

Sustained malfunctioning has forced MCV Hypatia to stop at an abandoned Old Humanity quarry, located on an orbit-locked asteroid close to Scirocco V. In order to reach the neutral planet in one piece, emergency repairs need to take place first in order to withstand the heat from passing through Scirocco V's atmosphere. The onboard mech pilots are to patrol the immediate area and repel any potential assaults from hostile parties.

# Goals
- Defend MCV Hypatia until the emergency repairs are over.
# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, MCV Hypatia will be destroyed along with the civilians onboard. The fate of the pilots is also put into question.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
