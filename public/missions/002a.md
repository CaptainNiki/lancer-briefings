# Mission // #002a
# Requestor: Dann Antares
## Traverse to Asteria-04


After successfully fending off the heavily armed Asteria-09 defense forces, the crew aboard Nautilus has set course for Asteria-04, another independent colony, with hopes of registering as an independent mercenary company. Dann hopes to resupply, as his cargo was confiscated by 09's security during a failed smuggler run. However, he is concerned that recent pirate activity in neutral territories may spell trouble for the fugitives on board.

# Objectives
- Defend Nautilus from any would-be assailants.
# Rewards
- Dann has kindly informed you that being stranded in space and/or ending up as pirate slaves is not really what civilized people would call "a grand old time". Maybe you should be taking his word to heart.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
