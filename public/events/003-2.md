## --- INITIATING LOG ---
*"Well shit, they actually did. Oh fuck, uh I mean..."* An audible cough can be heard, as the man talking clears his throat. *"Dann Antares of... I guess we are RLC now... Nautilus. Yeah, RLC Nautilus, I got the hang of it already. Things seem to be developing fine enough. The kids (and old lady) have managed to successfully seal the deal with Atlas, meaning that we have something to do for the foreseeable future. Now, this doesn't really benefit me long-term, given how my current occupation is proprietor of less than legal goods, but perhaps I should take the good with the bad in this situation. Heh. Just like the good old days, huh Dann?"*
