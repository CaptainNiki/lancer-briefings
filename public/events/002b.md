# ILU Nautilus // 03.12.503 CE
## --- INITIATING LOG ---
_"Captain Dann Antares of ICU Nautilus, December 3rd, 503. We managed to repel a pirate headhunter detachment headed by Direwolf, a violent man who is known to attack merchant ships along the route of Asteria-04 to Frigea. We reached Asteria-04 and after a well deserved rest, secured a meeting with Richard Guile, the head of Atlas Corporation's outpost on the artificial colony. Of course, as nothing is ever simple, we have been asked to do what is basically grunt work in order to "seal our deal" with Atlas. Bunch of bullcrap. They are asking these guys to be slaves, holding our bounty in 09 as a knife on our throats. I got faith in these guys but this whole thing smells. Who's to say they don't plan to kill us and conveniently split the bounty with those Jagiellon cunts? Doesn't matter either way, we're neck deep in shit and we gotta swim to the top if we want to stop drowning in it."_
