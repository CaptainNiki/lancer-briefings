In a crew comprised of old ladies, sentient robots and young guys with cockney accents, one would expect to have seen it all. Thankfully, "Rook" Hachiko seems to disprove that notion. Another prisoner found in **Hannon Laboratories**, Hachiko has shown impressive aptitude in piloting the gargantuan frame **"Flying Castle"** in battle, using her **BUN-E** toy as a co-pilot of sorts. Why is it a castle? How is a child capable of driving said castle? Why does it fly? Excellent questions we won't be answering. That barcode of hers is a bit too distracting for that.
