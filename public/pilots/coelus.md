Anri Easton is the granddaughter of fellow Lancer, Del Easton. Smart but lazy,  she was never interested in going into farming or union work like Del. As a result, she never got a job, but is a member of a low rent license forging racket, using a jury-rigged printer to acquire fake licenses and print subpar materials in return for money. She only knows anything about the mechs because of the fake licenses she's procured and looking at their designs while printing. Her father has always been absent, while her mother (Del's daughter) was a lancer who got killed in a raid/terror attack some time in the past.
